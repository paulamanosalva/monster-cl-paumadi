# Monster CL design proposal

This is the current Monster Energy website for Chile

I think it could be a little more fun by adding some elements related to the product, such as skateboarding and extreme sports like motocross. Because we all know what the drinks look like, so we could add more meaning to the brand by showing related concepts.

I did this for desktop as an initial design, so it's not responsive yet. 


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
